Easy!Appointments - WordPress Plugin

== Description ==
This plugin aims to bridge an Easy!Appointments installation with an existing WordPress system and make them work 
together. It will feature useful functions such as the integration of the booking wizard inside the WordPress pages 
through a shortcode and the creation of a new E!A installation directly from the WordPress backend.
